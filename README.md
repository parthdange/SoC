This is the SoC project by Parth Dange for Anime Club IITB website using Django

First, I learnt HTML and CSS and used them to make a personal webpage in April 2021. The repository link for its code is : https://github.com/SoC-Club-Website/assignment-1-parthdange and the webpage link is https://soc-club-website.github.io/assignment-1-parthdange/ and the code is uploaded in this repo as well.

In June 2021, I learnt JavaScript and bootstrap. I made a webpage as an assignment to implement javascript. The repo link is https://github.com/SoC-Club-Website/assignment-2-parthdange and the hosted webpage link is https://soc-club-website.github.io/assignment-2-parthdange/ and the code is uploaded in this repo as well.

In July 2021, I learnt python and Django and we started working on and completed our final project website. The link for the final project repository is https://github.com/SoC-Club-Website/final-website and the hosted website link is https://anime-club-iitb.herokuapp.com/ . I have not uploaded that code here as it is shared work so please checkout that linked repository. 
I contributed mainly to making the message board feature which is like a social media which allows users to make and use posts, working mainly for the backend part using django. I contributed to the base functioning of the site and added features like commenting, support for posting images and login.
